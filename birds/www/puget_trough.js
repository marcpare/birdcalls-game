Females and immatures are duller, with variable amounts of gray on the head and chest and a whitish lower belly.\n\n\nBehavior\nPurple Martins fly rapidly with a mix of flapping and gliding. They feed in midair, catching large, aerial insects such as dragonflies. Martins feed and roost in flocks, often mixed with other species of swallows. They often feed higher in the air than other swallows, which can make them tough to spot.\n\n\nHabitat\nPurple Martins are colonial, with dozens of martins nesting in the same spot; they feed in open areas, especially near water.

In 1831, he remarked, \u201cAlmost every country tavern has a martin box on the upper part of its sign-board; and I have observed that the handsomer the box, the better does the inn generally prove to be.\u201dNative Americans hung up empty gourds for the Purple Martin before Europeans arrived in North America. Purple Martins in eastern North America now nest almost exclusively in birdhouses, but those in the West use mostly natural cavities.European Starlings and House Sparrows often push Purple Martins out of local areas by taking over all of the nest sites, including houses that people put up specifically for the martins.Purple Martins roost together by the thousands in late summer, as soon as the chicks leave the nest. They form such dense gatherings that you can easily see them on weather radar. It\u2019s particularly noticeable in the early morning as the birds leave their roosts for the day, and looks like an expanding donut on the radar map.Despite the term \"scout\" used for the first returning Purple Martins, the first arriving individuals are not checking out the area to make sure it is safe for the rest of the group. They are the older martins returning to areas where they nested before. Martins returning north to breed for their first time come back several weeks later. The earlier return of older individuals is a common occurrence in species of migratory birds.The Purple Martin not only gets all its food in flight, it gets all its water that way too. It skims the surface of a pond and scoops up the water with its lower bill.The Purple Martin Conservation Association supports the study of the Purple Martin and provides information on its website.

In bad weather they occasionally forage on the ground.\nDietAlthough claims of Purple Martins eating 2,000 mosquitoes a day have not been substantiated, Purple Martins do eat flying insects almost exclusively.\nNestingPurple Martins form monogamous pairs that last through the nesting season, but not from season to season. They are cavity nesters that historically nested in tree cavities, old woodpecker holes, rotted pilings, and other natural cavities. Now most Purple Martins nest in man-made nest boxes. Eastern colonial populations are well known for nesting in large group nest boxes ('apartment buildings'), but Washington's martins will not use these group boxes and prefer to nest singly in boxes over water. Within the nest box, both members of the pair build a nest cup of leaves, grass, and twigs, with mud at the base of the entrance hole. The female incubates 4 to 5 eggs for 15 to 18 days, possibly with some incubation by the male, and both members of the pair feed the young. The young leave the nest at 28 to 29 days, and the parents continue to feed them for 5 to 7 more days.

Immatures are browner overall, palest on the neck and breast.  In the breeding season, adults develop a small double crest of stringy black or white feathers.\n\n\nBehavior\nDouble-crested Cormorants float low on the surface of water and dive to catch small fish. After fishing, they stand on docks, rocks, and tree limbs with wings spread open to dry. In flight, they often travel in V-shaped flocks that shift and reform as the birds alternate bursts of choppy flapping with short glides.  \n\n\nHabitat\nDouble-crested Cormorants are the most widespread cormorant in North America, and the one most frequently seen in freshwater. They breed on the coast as well as on large inland lakes.  They form colonies of stick nests built high in trees on islands or in patches of flooded timber.  \n\n\n\n", "habitat": "Lake/Pond", "cool_facts": "Cool FactsFrom a distance, Double-crested Cormorants are dark birds with snaky necks, but up-close they\u2019re quite colorful\u2014with orange-yellow skin on their face and throat, striking aquamarine eyes that sparkle like jewels, and a mouth that is bright blue on the inside.The double-crest of the Double-crested Cormorant is only visible on adults during breeding season. The crests are white in cormorants from Alaska, and black in other regions.  Cormorants often stand in the sun with their wings spread out to dry. They have less preen oil than other birds, so their feathers can get soaked rather than shedding water like a duck\u2019s. Though this seems like a problem for a bird that spends its life in water, wet feathers probably make it easier for cormorants to hunt underwater with agility and speed.Double-crested Cormorant nests often are exposed to direct sun. Adults shade the chicks and also bring them water, pouring it from their mouths into those of the chicks.In breeding colonies where the nests are placed on the ground, young cormorants leave their nests and congregate into groups with other youngsters (creches). They return to their own nests to be fed.Accumulated fecal matter below nests can kill the nest trees. When this happens, the cormorants may move to a new area or they may simply shift to nesting on the ground.The Double-crested Cormorant makes a bulky nest of sticks and other materials. It frequently picks up junk, such as rope, deflated balloons, fishnet, and plastic debris to incorporate into the nest. Parts of dead birds are commonly used too.Large pebbles are occasionally found in cormorant nests, and the cormorants treat them as eggs.The oldest known Double-crested Cormorant was more than 22 years old, banded in Ontario in 1984 and found in Louisiana in 2006.", "common_name": "Double-crested Cormorant", "call": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/sounds/dcco1.mp3", "images": [{"contributor": "Joseph V.

They often perch on rocks, sandbars, or pilings near fishing sites and forage at ponds, lakes, slow-moving rivers, estuaries, and open coastlines.  Their breeding colonies are typically located on small rocky or sandy islands, or on the exposed tops of offshore rocks. They may also nest or roost in trees, especially when predators are present.\nBehaviorGregarious throughout the year, Double-crested Cormorants nest in colonies, form dense nocturnal roosts, and travel in flocks during migration. They forage in shallow water within sight of land. They dive from the water's surface to pursue prey underwater, propelled by powerful, webbed feet. After a bout of foraging, they may be seen on exposed perches with their wings spread, drying their feathers. Males attract females by performing a conspicuous 'wing-waving display' that emphasizes their colorful head-tufts and neck.\nDietOpportunistic feeders, Double-crested Cormorants take a variety of prey species depending on availability. They feed principally on slow-moving or schooling species of fish, and they occasionally consume insects, crustaceans, and amphibians.\nNestingUnpaired males begin advertising for females shortly after choosing a nest site. The male brings nest material to the female, and the female does most of the building. The nest, a platform of sticks and debris, may be found on a rocky cliff near water, on the ground on an island, or in a tree. As the breeding season progresses, nest materials become cemented together by droppings. Both parents incubate the 3 to 4 eggs. The altricial young are fed regurgitated food by both parents. After leaving the nest, the young roam the colony in groups called cr\u00e8ches and return to the nest site to be fed. The young are completely independent of their parents at 10 weeks.

Juveniles show irregular rusty spotting in the breast band.\n\n\nBehavior\nBelted Kingfishers spend much of their time perched alone along the edges of streams, lakes, and estuaries, searching for small fish. They also fly quickly up and down rivers and shorelines giving loud rattling calls. They hunt either by plunging directly from a perch, or by hovering over the water, bill downward, before diving after a fish they\u2019ve spotted.\n\n\nHabitat\nKingfishers live near streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and estuaries. They nest in burrows that they dig into soft earthen banks, usually adjacent to or directly over water.

Human activity, such as road building and digging gravel pits, has created banks where kingfishers can nest and allowed the expansion of the breeding range.The Belted Kingfisher is one of the few bird species in which the female is more brightly colored than the male. Among the nearly 100 species of kingfishers, the sexes often look alike. In some species the male is more colorful, and in others the female is.During breeding season the Belted Kingfisher pair defends a territory against other kingfishers. A territory along a stream includes just the streambed and the vegetation along it, and averages 0.6 mile long. The nest burrow is usually in a dirt bank near water. The tunnel slopes upward from the entrance, perhaps to keep water from entering the nest. Tunnel length ranges from 1 to 8 feet.As nestlings, Belted Kingfishers have acidic stomachs that help them digest bones, fish scales, and arthropod shells. But by the time they leave the nest, their stomach chemistry apparently changes, and they begin regurgitating pellets which accumulate on the ground around fishing and roosting perches. Scientists can dissect these pellets to learn about the kingfisher\u2019s diet without harming or even observing any wild birds.Belted Kingfishers wander widely, sometimes showing up in the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, the British Isles, the Azores, Iceland, Greenland, and the Netherlands.Pleistocene fossils of Belted Kingfishers (to 600,000 years old) have been unearthed in Florida, Virginia, Tennessee, and Texas.

They require sandy vertical banks for nest burrows and clear water so they can see their aquatic prey.\nBehaviorBelted Kingfishers perch or hover over open water, watching for prey.  Once prey is sighted, they dive headfirst into the water and seize it with their bills.  Typically prey is taken near the surface, and the birds do not submerge themselves completely.  Belted Kingfishers are highly territorial and vigorously defend their territories.  Their most common call is a dry rattle, often given in flight.\nDietBelted Kingfishers almost always take food from the water, feeding predominantly on small fish. They will also prey on crayfish, frogs, tadpoles, and other aquatic dwellers.\nNestingThe Belted Kingfisher nests in burrows dug in sandy banks.

Pied-billed Grebes pay for their aquatic prowess on land, where they walk awkwardly.Pied-billed Grebe chicks typically leave the nest the first day after hatching and spend much of their first week riding around on a parent\u2019s back. They usually spend most of their first 3 weeks on or near the nest platform.Pied-billed Grebes are fairly poor fliers and typically stay on the water\u2014although rare individuals have managed to fly as far as the Hawaiian Islands, Europe, the Azores, and the Canary Islands.Pied-billed Grebes can trap water in their feathers, giving them great control over their buoyancy. They can sink deeply or stay just at or below the surface, exposing as much or as little of the body as they wish. The water-trapping ability may also aid in the pursuit of prey by reducing drag in turbulent water.Like other grebes, the Pied-billed Grebe eats large quantities of its own feathers. Feathers may at times fill up more than half of a grebe\u2019s stomach, and they are sometimes fed to newly hatched chicks. The ingested plumage appears to form a sieve-like plug that prevents hard, potentially harmful prey parts from passing into the intestine, and it helps form indigestible items into pellets which they can regurgitate. When in danger, Pied-billed Grebes sometimes make a dramatic  \u201ccrash-dive\u201d to get away. A crash-diving grebe pushes its body down with its wings thrust outward.

During the winter they are found on both fresh and salt water, although they are much more likely to be found on fresh water.  More open water is used during winter, as the birds do not have nests to anchor at this time.  Pied-billed Grebes often use areas near rivers, typically bodies of still water. In migration Pied-billed Grebes can be found at higher elevations, even in mountain lakes.\nBehaviorPied-billed Grebes are less social than most species of grebes and are rarely found in flocks.

The nests are usually located on dry land close to water, in areas with dense cover, especially bulrush. The female builds the nest, which is a shallow bowl lined with grass and down. She lays 8 to 10 eggs and incubates them for 21 to 27 days. The male leaves when incubation begins. The young leave the nest within a day of hatching and head to the water, where they are tended by the female, but feed themselves.

It swallows most of its prey underwater. The loon has sharp, rearward-pointing projections on the roof of its mouth and tongue that help it keep a firm hold on slippery fish.Loons are water birds, only going ashore to mate and incubate eggs. Their legs are placed far back on their bodies, allowing efficient swimming but only awkward movement on land.Loons are agile swimmers, but they move pretty fast in the air, too. Migrating loons have been clocked flying at speeds more than 70 mph. A hungry loon family can put away a lot of fish. Biologists estimate that loon parents and their 2 chicks can eat about a half-ton of fish over a 15-week period. Loons are like airplanes in that they need a runway for takeoff. In the case of loons, they need from 30 yards up to a quarter-mile (depending on the wind) for flapping their wings and running across the top of the water in order to gain enough speed for lift-off. Loons are well equipped for their submarine maneuvers to catch fish. Unlike most birds, loons have solid bones that make them less buoyant and better at diving. They can quickly blow air out of their lungs and flatten their feathers to expel air within their plumage, so they can dive quickly and swim fast underwater. Once below the surface, the loon\u2019s heart slows down to conserve oxygen.Like many young birds, juvenile loons are really on their own after mom and dad leave at about 12 weeks. The parents head off on migration in the fall, leaving juveniles to gather into flocks on northern lakes and make their own journey south a few weeks later. Once the juveniles reach coastal waters on the ocean, they stay there for the next two years. In the third year, young loons return north, although they may not breed for several more years (on average they are six years old when they start breeding).Migrating Common Loons occasionally land on wet highways or parking lots, mistaking them for rivers and lakes. They become stranded without a considerable amount of open water for a long takeoff. A loon may also get stranded on a pond that is too small.The Common Loon is flightless for a few weeks after molting all of its wing feathers at the same time in midwinter.The oldest-known Common Loon lived at least 24 years, 1 month, spending its summers on a lake in Michigan.", "common_name": "Common Loon", "call": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/sounds/colo.mp3", "images": [{"contributor": "Joseph V.

These lakes can be in forested areas in mountains or lowlands. Islands, logs, and floating debris attract nesting loons. In winter, Common Loons are usually found on salt water, typically in shallow areas close to shore. They occasionally winter on fresh water.\nBehaviorIn winter, Common Loons are solitary while feeding, but they congregate in loose flocks at night. Before diving, they sometimes swim along the surface with heads partly submerged, looking for prey. When swimming under water, they use only their feet for propulsion.\nDiet\tCommon Loons generally eat small fish up to 10\" long, and also take crustaceans, mollusks, aquatic insects, leeches, and frogs.

Although sharing of information about food at the colony seems unintentional, when a swallow finds food away from the colony during poor weather conditions it may give a specific call that alerts other Cliff Swallows that food is available. By alerting other swallows to a large insect swarm an individual may ensure that the swarm is tracked and that it can follow the swarm effectively.Although the Cliff Swallow can nest solitarily, it usually nests in colonies. Colonies tend to be small in the East, but further west they can number up to 3,700 nests in one spot.Within a Cliff Swallow colony some swallows lay eggs in another swallow's nest. Sometimes the swallow may lay eggs in its own nest and then carry one of its eggs in its bill and put it in another female's nest.When young Cliff Swallows leave their nests they congregate in large groups called creches.

Many still nest in these habitats, but others have adapted to nesting on man-made structures, especially under bridges and freeways. Cliff Swallows can be seen in farmland, wetlands, prairies, residential areas, road cuts and over open water. They require a source of mud for their nests, and they apparently have specific nesting requirements that are as yet unknown, as their distribution is patchy, and there are many areas that appear to be suitable habitat that host no Cliff Swallows.\nBehaviorCliff Swallows forage high in the air, soaring in circles, but they are less agile in flight than other Washington swallows. This is one of the most social land-birds of North America, generally nesting in large colonies (of up to 3,500 nests!) During nesting season Cliff Swallows gather at mud puddles to collect mud that they carry to their nests in their bills. While at these puddles, both males and females flutter their wings up high, which appears to prevent attempts at forced copulation. Extra-pair copulations are common, as is brood parasitism. Females will lay eggs in other females' nests and will also carry eggs in their beaks from their own nests to the nests of others.\nDietCliff Swallows feed almost entirely on flying insects.\nNestingCliff Swallows have tidy, well-constructed nests, formed from balls of mud that they collect in their beaks. These nests are built on vertical walls, natural or man-made, frequently with some sort of sheltering overhang. Barns, bridges, and large buildings are regularly used. Birds of both sexes begin by dabbing a circle of mud onto a wall and then adding mud-balls from the bottom of the rim up and out, eventually forming a jug-shaped nest. Unlike Barn Swallows, they do not add sticks or straw to the mud structure, but they do line the nest with grass and feathers. Both members of the pair incubate the four to five eggs for 14 to 16 days. Both feed the young, which leave the nest 21 to 23 days after hatching. The parents continue to feed the young for three to five days after they leave the nest.

When tested at only two days of age, chicks showed a preference for magnetic bearings that would take them in the appropriate direction for their fall migration. The gulls also rely on landmarks and high-altitude winds to provide directional cues. Ring-billed Gulls near Tampa Bay, Florida, became accustomed to feasting on garbage at an open landfill site.

Scientists track Ospreys by strapping lightweight satellite transmitters to the birds\u2019 backs. The devices pinpoint an Osprey's location to within a few hundred yards and last for 2-3 years. During 13 days in 2008, one Osprey flew 2,700 miles\u2014from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, to French Guiana, South America. Ospreys are unusual among hawks in possessing a reversible outer toe that allows them to grasp with two toes in front and two behind. Barbed pads on the soles of the birds' feet help them grip slippery fish. When flying with prey, an Osprey lines up its catch head first for less wind resistance. Ospreys are excellent anglers. Over several studies, Ospreys caught fish on at least 1 in every 4 dives, with success rates sometimes as high as 70 percent. The average time they spent hunting before making a catch was about 12 minutes\u2014something to think about next time you throw your line in the water.The Osprey readily builds its nest on manmade structures, such as telephone poles, channel markers, duck blinds, and nest platforms designed especially for it. Such platforms have become an important tool in reestablishing Ospreys in areas where they had disappeared. In some areas nests are placed almost exclusively on artificial structures.Osprey eggs do not hatch all at once. Rather, the first chick emerges up to five days before the last one. The older hatchling dominates its younger siblings, and can monopolize the food brought by the parents. If food is abundant, chicks share meals in relative harmony; in times of scarcity, younger ones may starve to death.\nThe name \"Osprey\" made its first appearance around 1460, via the Medieval Latin phrase for \"bird of prey\" (avis prede).

They fly with slow wing-beats interspersed with glides.  Ospreys form pair bonds through aerial flight displays and courtship feeding.\nDietThe vast majority of the Osprey's diet is fish, typically 5-16 inches in size. Only occasionally, when fish aren't available, will the Osprey eat small mammals, birds, or reptiles. However, the Osprey is highly specialized for eating fish and does not stray from this diet unless necessary.

A golden statue in Salt Lake City commemorates the event, and in   recognition the California Gull was made the state bird of Utah.The California Gull, like most gulls, is an   opportunistic feeder, eating anything it can catch or scavenge. It has an odd   foraging strategy for catching alkali flies along the shores of salty lakes in   the Great Basin. It starts at one end of a huge raft of flies sitting on the   beach and runs through the flies with its head down and bill open, snapping up   flies.                                                                                                       Both parents incubate the eggs, taking turns   throughout the day at about three to four hour intervals. Usually an adult   calls as it flies into the nest area. The incubating gull stands up and gives   several \"Long Calls\" as its mate lands near the nest. The returning mate joins   in calling, and the pair sometimes walks around their tiny territory together.   Sometimes the incubating bird does not stand up right away, and the returning   mate has to resort to making different display calls, presenting nest material   to the incubator, or physically nudging the bird to get it off the nest.                                       Two different subspecies of California Gull exist.   The gulls that breed in the Great Basin region of the western United States   are smaller and darker backed, and those breeding in the Great Plains are   larger and paler.

It is common far from land in late summer and fall. As a breeder, it can survive in habitats that are too harsh for Herring and Ring-billed Gulls. During the breeding season, California Gulls inhabit lakes, farms, and marshes. They typically nest on gravel islands in large rivers or lakes. In winter, they spend time in nearly every habitat found along the Pacific Coast.\nBehaviorCalifornia Gulls use a variety of foraging strategies, feeding while walking, wading, swimming, or flying. They are often seen on farms or in fields, following behind the plows and picking up insects uncovered by the machinery. They have also been reported to lie in wait for rodents to be flooded out of their holes when fields are irrigated.\nDietIn Washington, California Gulls feed in agricultural lands, cities, and wetlands near their nesting areas. In agricultural areas in this state, they feed primarily on small rodents. Insects, fish, eggs, and garbage are also part of the diet of this opportunistic feeder.\nNestingCalifornia Gulls begin breeding at the age of four. They are colony nesters, sometimes in mixed colonies with Ring-billed or Herring Gulls, although they don't typically hybridize with either of those species. The colonies are usually large and are often on an island.  Nests are located on the ground, and may be quite close together. The birds form monogamous pair bonds for the duration of the breeding season and may re-pair in succeeding seasons.  However, they often pair with different birds, even when both members of a former pair are still alive. Both help build the nest, a shallow scrape in the ground lined with weeds, bones, feathers, and other debris. Clutches are usually 2-3 eggs, and nests with more than 3 eggs are attributed to multiple females. Both parents help incubate the eggs for about 3\u00bd weeks. The young leave the nest after a few days, but stay nearby, fed regurgitated food by their parents until they can fly at the age of about 6\u00bd weeks.\n"}, {"family": "Ducks, Geese and Swans (Family Anatidae)", "description": "\n\n\n\nSize & Shape\nMallards are large ducks with hefty bodies, rounded heads, and wide, flat bills.

Domestic ducks can be common in city ponds and can be confusing to identify\u2014they may lack the white neck ring, show white on the chest, be all dark, or show oddly shaped crests on the head. The widespread Mallard has given rise to a number of populations around the world that have changed enough that they could be considered separate species. The \"Mexican Duck\" of central Mexico and the extreme southwestern United States and the Hawaiian Duck both are closely related to the Mallard, and in both forms the male is dull like the female. The Mexican Duck currently is considered a subspecies of the Mallard, while the Hawaiian Duck is still given full species status.Mallard pairs are generally monogamous, but paired males pursue females other than their mates. So-called \u201cextra-pair copulations\u201d are common among birds and in many species are consensual, but male Mallards often force these copulations, with several males chasing a single female and then mating with her. Mallard pairs form long before the spring breeding season. Pairing takes place in the fall, but courtship can be seen all winter. Only the female incubates the eggs and takes care of the ducklings.Ducks are strong fliers; migrating flocks of Mallards have been estimated traveling at 55 miles per hour.The standard duck\u2019s quack is the sound of a female Mallard. Males don\u2019t quack; they make a quieter, rasping sound.Mallards, like other ducks, shed all their flight feathers at the end of the breeding season and are flightless for 3\u20134 weeks. They are secretive during this vulnerable time, and their body feathers molt into a concealing \u201ceclipse\u201d plumage that can make them hard to identify.Many species of waterfowl form hybrids, and Mallards are particularly known for this, hybridizing with American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, Gadwall, Northern Pintail, Cinnamon Teal, Green-winged Teal, and Canvasback, as well as Hawaiian Ducks, the Grey Duck of New Zealand, and the Pacific Black Duck of Australia.

He dives close to a female, his feathers making a loud whining sound near the bottom of an oval trajectory.  Rufous Hummingbirds are highly territorial, defending feeding territories not only while breeding but also during migration.  Rufous Hummingbirds do not sing but make warning chips in response to perceived threats.  Their wings make a whine much like the sound of a cicada.\nDietRufous Hummingbirds feed on insects and on nectar from flowers.  In Washington, they feed heavily on red flowering currant, salmonberry, honeysuckle, and on sugar-water at hummingbird feeders.\nNestingThe female Rufous Hummingbird commonly builds her nest over the previous year's nest, which is typically 2 to 10 feet from the ground in a coniferous tree.  In the Puget Sound area, nests are often built among huckleberry bushes, alders, blackberries, or drooping conifer branches.  In western Washington, protection from rain and other weather is a major factor in nest location.  Nests built early in the breeding season are situated low in conifers, protecting them from the rain and cold.  Nests built later in the summer are found high in deciduous trees where they are less likely to overheat.  The nest is built with moss, lined with plant down, covered on the outside with lichen and bark, and held together with spider webbing.  The female lays two eggs and incubates them for 15-17 days.  She feeds and cares for the young by herself until they become independent at about 21 days.\n"}, {"family": "Pigeons and Doves (Family Columbidae)", "description": "\n\n\n\nSize & Shape\nPlump-bodied and long-tailed, with short legs, small bill, and a head that looks particularly small in comparison to the body.

These roosts can be of a few hundred up to two million crows. Some roosts have been forming in the same general area for well over 100 years. In the last few decades some of these roosts have moved into urban areas where the noise and mess cause conflicts with people.Young American Crows do not breed until they are at least two years old, and most do not breed until they are four or more. In most populations the young help their parents raise young for a few years. Families may include up to 15 individuals and contain young from five different years.In some areas, the American Crow has a double life. It maintains a territory year round in which the entire extended family lives and forages together. But during much of the year, individual crows leave the home territory to join large flocks at dumps and agricultural fields, and to sleep in large roosts in winter. Family members go together to the flocks, but do not stay together in the crowd. A crow may spend part of the day at home with its family in town and the rest with a flock feeding on waste grain out in the country.Despite its tendency to eat roadkill, the American Crow is not specialized to be a scavenger, and carrion is only a very small part of its diet. Though their bills are large, crows can\u2019t break through the skin of even a gray squirrel. They must wait for something else to open a carcass or for the carcass to decompose and become tender enough to eat.Crows are crafty foragers that sometimes follow adult birds to find where their nests are hidden.

A group of crows was seen distracting a river otter to steal its fish, and another group followed Common Mergansers to catch minnows the ducks were chasing into the shallows. They also sometimes follow songbirds as they arrive from a long migration flight and capture the exhausted birds.

It flies low to the ground to pick up the scent of dead animals.Vultures in the Americas look a lot like the vultures in Europe, Asia, and Africa, with broad wings, bare heads, and the habit of eating dead meat. But surprisingly, they're in different taxonomic families, meaning they're not particularly closely related. They evolved many of the same features as they exploited the same kinds of resources in different parts of the planet. This process is known as convergent evolution.Not everyone sees vultures as a creepy harbinger of death\u2014many see them as sacred for their cleanup role. Tibetan Buddhists practice \u201csky burials,\u201d where animals, usually vultures, consume their dead. Similarly, Zoroastrians offer their dead to be consumed by vultures on a raised platform, called a dakhma. They regard vultures are precious animals that release the soul from the body. However, in parts of urban India, where vultures have become scarce because of accidental poisoning by a livestock anti-inflammatory drug, not enough vultures remain to meet the demand and some people have turned to burial.

Rocky outcroppings, cliffs, and dry forests provide nesting sites, while open areas are prime foraging habitat.\nBehaviorUnlike most birds, Turkey Vultures have a well-developed sense of smell. As they soar over foraging areas, they scan the ground, searching for carrion or scavengers that might signal the presence of something dead. When they locate food, they eat it in place. They usually forage alone, but sometimes congregate around food sources. In the Pacific Northwest, they roost communally in small groups.

Though they\u2019re erratic, these movements may not be entirely random. Banding data suggest that some birds may fly west-east across the continent while others move north-south. For more, see this  post from Project FeederWatch.Following a large irruptive winter flight, some individuals may stay near a dependable food source and breed far south of the normal breeding range.\nBird-banding projects are invaluable for tracking migrating birds, even though few bands are ever recovered for small birds like siskins. Nearly 675,000 Pine Siskins were banded between 1960 and 2011; fewer than 2,000 were later found. By contrast, about one-quarter of the nearly 5,000,000 geese banded in the same period were recovered.\nPine Siskins get through cold nights by ramping up their metabolic rates\u2014typically 40% higher than a \u201cnormal\u201d songbird of their size. When temperatures plunge as low as \u201370\u00b0C (\u201394\u00b0F), they can accelerate that rate up to five times normal for several hours. They also put on half again as much winter fat as their Common Redpoll and American Goldfinch relatives.Pine Siskins protect their eggs from cold damage, too. The nest is highly insulated, and the female remains on the nest continuously, fed by the male throughout brooding. Pine Siskins can temporarily store seeds totaling as much as 10% of their body mass in a part of their esophagus called the crop.

They may nest in loose colonies or in isolated pairs, and their breeding activity is more closely tied to the abundance of food than to season.  Nests are well hidden, on a horizontal branch well out from the trunk of a conifer tree.  The female builds a large, shallow cup of twigs, grass, bark strips, rootlets, leaves, and lichen, lined with moss, plant down, hair, and feathers.  The female incubates 3 to 4 eggs for about 13 days.  The male brings her food while she incubates, and while she broods the young for the first few days after they hatch.

Song Sparrows of the Desert Southwest are pale, while those in the Pacific Northwest are dark and heavily streaked. Song Sparrows of Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands chain are even darker, and they\u2019re huge: one-third longer than the eastern birds, and weighing twice as much. Some scientists think that Song Sparrows of wet, coastal areas have darker plumage as a defense against feather mites and other decay agents that thrive in humid climates. The darker plumage contains more of a pigment called melanin, which makes feathers tougher and harder to degrade than lighter, unpigmented feathers. The range of the Song Sparrow is continuous from the Aleutians to the eastern United States. There\u2019s also an isolated population that lives on the plateau of central Mexico, about 900 miles from the next closest population. These Song Sparrows have white throats and chests with black streaks. Song Sparrows seem to have a clear idea of what makes a good nest. Field researchers working for many years on the same parcels of land have noticed that some choice spots  \u2013 the base of a rose bush, or a particular hollow under a hummock of grass, for example \u2013 get used over and over again, even when entirely new birds take over the territory.Despite the large differences in size and coloration across the Song Sparrow\u2019s range, genetic divergence is low. High rates of immigration and emigration may keep populations genetically similar, while local selective conditions maintain the physical differences. Like many other songbirds, the male Song Sparrow uses its song to attract mates as well as defend its territory. Laboratory studies have shown that the female Song Sparrow is attracted not just to the song itself, but to how well it reflects the ability of the male to learn. Males that used more learned components in their songs and that better matched their song tutors (the adult bird they learned their songs from) were preferred. Song Sparrows often lay two or more clutches of eggs per breeding season. In exceptional circumstances, such as when resources are abundant or predation causes the loss of several clutches in a row, Song Sparrows have laid as many as seven clutches in a single breeding season, and have successfully reared up to four clutches.The Song Sparrow, like most other North American breeding birds, uses increasing day length as a cue for when to come into breeding condition. But, other cues can be important too, such as local temperature and food abundance. A study found that male Song Sparrows from the coast of Washington state came into breeding condition two months earlier than Song Sparrows in the nearby mountains, where the daylight changes were the same, but temperatures were cooler and trees budded out two months later.

The planting of exotic flowering trees provided nectar and nesting sites, and allowed the hummingbird to greatly expand its breeding range.The dive display of the Anna's Hummingbird lasts about 12 seconds, and the male may fly to a height of 40 m (131 feet) during the display. He starts by hovering two to four meters (6-13 feet) in front of the display object (hummingbird or person), and then climbs in a wavering fashion straight up. He plummets in a near-vertical dive from the top of the climb and ends with an explosive squeak within half a meter of the display object. He then makes a circular arc back to the point where he began. On sunny days the dives are oriented so that the sun is reflected from the iridescent throat and crown directly at the object of the dive.On rare occasions, bees and wasps may become impaled on the bill of an Anna's Hummingbird, causing the bird to starve to death.Hummingbirds are strictly a New World animal. They fascinated the first Europeans who arrived on the continent. Christopher Columbus wrote about them and many wondered if they were a cross between a bird and an insect (at one point being called \u201cflybirds\u201d). Later, their feathers became fashionable ornaments in Europe (a practice that has thankfully fallen out of favor).What do you call a flock of hummingbirds? Few animals have so many applicable terms, and none so beautiful. Instead of calling them a flock, choose between a bouquet, a glittering, a hover, a shimmer, or a tune of hummingbirds.Native Americans held hummingbirds in high esteem. Many of their legends describe them as busily bring the rain to quench eruptions or poking holes in the night sky that became the stars. The Navajo say that the characteristic mating dive is a way for them to check what is above the blue of the sky.The iridescent throat patch of male hummingbirds is called a gorget.

The differences are significant enough to lead ornithologists to recognize six separate subspecies of Warbling Vireo, and at one time divided them into two species.Brown-headed Cowbirds frequently deposit their own eggs in the nests of Warbling Vireos. In some instances, the vireo pair incubates the alien egg and raises the young cowbird until it fledges. Female vireos in some eastern populations, however, tend to puncture and eject interlopers\u2019 eggs. Researchers speculate that Warbling Vireo song is at least partially learned rather than hard-wired. They base this supposition in part on observations of one individual whose song more closely resembled that of a Red-eyed Vireo than that of its parents. The garbled song, they concluded, probably resulted from a flawed learning process during the bird\u2019s development.

Spiders and small berries make up the remaining 5%, with most berry-eating confined to the late summer and fall.\nNestingWarbling Vireos are monogamous. Nests are located in the periphery of deciduous trees and shrubs. Birds of the western subspecies place their nest within 30 feet of the ground, lower than those of the eastern subspecies. Both members of the pair build the nest, which is suspended from a horizontally forked branch. The nest is made of bark strips, grass, leaves, plant fibers, hair, and lichen. Both parents incubate the four eggs for 12 to 14 days. Both feed and tend the young for the 13 to 14 days they are in the nest and for up to two weeks after they leave it.

They are found in more varied habitats than any other owl in North America.  They often use wooded habitats, especially during the breeding season when trees or heavy brush provide cover.  However they also nest in cliffs in arid areas far from trees.  Their preferred habitat is open or fragmented woodland with treeless areas nearby.\nBehaviorLike most owls, Great Horned Owls have keen hearing and keen vision in low light, both adaptations for hunting at night.  These aggressive and powerful hunters most commonly use a sit-and-wait approach, watching from a perch and swooping down on passing prey to seize it with their talons.\nDietGreat Horned Owls are opportunistic generalists, taking advantage of whatever prey is available.  They have the widest prey base of any North American owl.  In most places, most of their food consists of mammals such as rabbits, skunks, and large rodents.

To a lesser extent, Great Horned Owls also take reptiles, amphibians, fish, and even large insects.\nNestingGreat Horned Owls are early nesters and begin calling in courtship in early winter.  Monogamous pairs form long-term bonds.  Though they sometimes nest in caves or on cliff ledges, they most often nest in deciduous trees.  Great Horned Owls do not build their own nests, but use nests built by hawks, crows, magpies, herons, or other large birds.  Most are abandoned nests from previous years, but Great Horned Owls also take over active nests.  They add no new nest material.  Since nesting typically begins in late January or February, before trees begin to leaf out, Great Horned Owls on the nest can often be seen easily.  The female incubates 1-4 eggs for 30-37 days while the male brings her food.  The young remain in the nest for about 6 weeks, then climb out onto nearby branches.

It is suspected that the House Wren, which frequently removes eggs from nests in cavities, was directly responsible for the decline. The increased availability of nest boxes may have helped the spread of the House Wren, and therefore the decline of the Bewick's Wren.The male Bewick's Wren learns its song while still on the parents' territory. It learns the song not from its father, but rather from the neighboring territorial males. The song repertoire developed before the first winter is retained for life.This species is named after British engraver Thomas Bewick\u2014a friend of pioneering bird artist John James Audubon, who collected the first recognized specimen. After collecting a bird in 1821 in Louisiana, Audubon saw another and wrote, \"I refrained from killing it, in order to observe its habits.\u2026 It moved along the bars of the fences, with its tail generally erect, looking from the bar on which it stood towards the one next above, and caught spiders and other insects, as it ran along from one panel of the fence to another in quick succession.\" Courting Bewick\u2019s Wrens normally form monogamous pairs. While they\u2019re setting up house and even after the female has begun incubating eggs, the male and female often forage together. This may help the male prevent his partner from mating with another bird.A young male Bewick\u2019s Wren learns to sing from neighboring adult males while he is coming of age in his parents\u2019 territory. The songs he develops differ from his father\u2019s, with a note changed here, a syllable there. The melodious signature he acquires between the ages of about 30 and 60 days will be his for life. A Bewick\u2019s Wren\u2019s life starts off perilously. House Wrens may eject eggs from its nest; both eggs and nestlings can become lunch for rat snakes and milk snakes, and domestic cats go after nestlings.

As the season progresses their nests can become infested with mites and other parasites that feed on the wren nestlings. Perhaps to fight this problem, wrens often add spider egg sacs into the materials they build their nests from. In lab studies, once the spiders hatched, they helped the wrens by devouring the nest parasites.A House Wren weighs about as much as two quarters, but it\u2019s a fierce competitor for nest holes. Wrens will harass and peck at much larger birds, sometimes dragging eggs and young out of a nest site they want \u2013 even occasionally killing adult birds. In some areas they are the main source of nest failure for bluebirds, Tree Swallows, Prothonotary Warblers, and chickadees.For House Wren eggs, temperature inside the nest box can be critical to survival. If a sun-drenched nest box warms above about 106 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour, the eggs will begin to die.

They also use a sit-and-wait style of hunting, scanning for prey from high perches. They are commonly seen along roadsides or soaring over open fields.\nDietRed-tailed Hawks eat many small mammals, especially rodents and rabbits. Birds, reptiles, and sometimes fish or large insects all fall prey to Red-tailed Hawks on occasion. They have also been known to steal prey from other raptors and to eat fresh carrion.\nNestingRed-tailed Hawks are monogamous and may remain paired throughout the year. At the beginning of the breeding season, they perform impressive aerial courtship flights, accompanied by shrill screams. The nest is built in a tall tree, often the tallest tree in a cluster, or on cliff ledges, towers, nest platforms, and occasionally buildings. In western Washington, the nest is usually in a hardwood tree, especially black cottonwood or red alder. Both sexes help build the nest, a bulky collection of sticks lined with bark and other fine material. Greenery is often added. Both help incubate the 2 to 3 eggs for 28 to 32 days. The female stays on the nest and broods the young for the first 30 to 35 days after they hatch. During this time the male brings food, which the female tears up and feeds to the young. At 42 to 46 days, the young leave the nest, but can't fly for another 2 to 3 weeks. The majority of juveniles don't start catching their own food until 6 to 7 weeks after they leave the nest, although some start sooner. Some juveniles may continue to associate with their parents for up to six months after they leave the nest.\n"}, {"family": "Thrushes (Family Turdidae)", "description": "\n\n\n\nSize & Shape\nWestern Bluebirds are small thrushes that usually perch upright.

During the breeding season, males often perch on a tall stalk to sing, and flick their wings and tails to attract females.\nDietCommon Yellowthroats eat insects and other small invertebrates. They also occasionally eat seeds.\nNestingCommon Yellowthroats are primarily monogamous. Pairs form shortly after the females arrive on the breeding grounds, about a week after the males. The female selects the nest site and builds the nest, which is usually within three feet of the ground in a shrub, or on the ground in a grass or weed tussock. The nest is a loose, bulky cup, sometimes with a partial roof, made of weeds, grass, sedge, and leaves, lined with fine bark, grass, and hair. The female incubates 3 to 5 eggs for 12 days. The male does not incubate the eggs, but brings food to the female while she is on the nest. Both parents feed the young, which leave the nest 8 to 10 days after hatching. The parents continue to feed the young for at least two weeks following fledging. Most pairs raise two broods a season. When the first brood fledges, the female starts the second brood and the male feeds the fledglings.\n"}, {"family": "Warblers (Family Parulidae)", "description": "\n\nAdult Description Small songbird.

Flocks of White-crowned Sparrows fan out into open ground away from sheltering bushes as they feed, flying back to cover in a wave if disturbed.  They forage on the ground in open areas, with sheltered thickets nearby for cover.  They use a two-footed scratching maneuver to locate food in the leaf litter.\nDietIn the winter, White-crowned Sparrows eat seeds, grass, buds, fruits, and arthropods. During the breeding season, arthropods make up a larger proportion of the diet.\nNestingMales generally arrive on the breeding grounds before females. The males sing to defend their territories and attract mates.  The nest is usually located on the ground at the base of a shrub or a clump of grass, in a depression so the rim is level with the ground.

It is known to steal milk from lactating female seals while they lie on their backs sleeping on the beach.The Western Gull hybridizes extensively with the Glaucous-winged Gull, with the hybrids being the most common form in Washington. The hybrids can be similar to the parent adult forms, but usually have intermediate back and wingtip coloring. With the medium-gray back, dark upper surface to wingtips, frosty white undersurface to wingtips and a darkish eye, a hybrid may closely resemble a robust Thayer's Gull. The flatter and larger head of the hybrid, and especially the thick bill with a pronounced angle on the bottom, should help distinguish it from the smaller, slimmer Thayer's Gull.The Yellow-footed Gull of the Gulf of California formerly was regarded as a race of the Western Gull. But its legs are a different color, and it also takes only three, not four, years to reach adult plumage.In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood. The female-biased sex ratio of some Western Gull colonies may have been the result of pollution by pesticides that acted like estrogen and made some male embryos develop as females.", "common_name": "Western Gull", "call": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/sounds/wegu.mp3", "images": [{"contributor": "Tom Grey", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/wegu_tg.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/tgrey"}, {"contributor": "Tom Grey", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/wegu_wfl_tg.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/tgrey"}, {"contributor": "Jeff Poklen", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/wegu_j_jp.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/jpkln"}, {"contributor": "Jeff Poklen", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/wegu_jfl_jp.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/jpkln"}], "life_history": "\nHabitatWestern Gulls are found mostly near the coast, and also found regularly offshore.

They will also situate colonies near sea lion breeding colonies and scavenge dead pups. Western Gulls, like many other gull species, drop hard-shelled items from the air to break them on hard surfaces. In very hot weather, adults may cool their eggs with their wet belly feathers.\nDietWestern Gulls are omnivores and eat a variety of things including fish and other aquatic creatures, eggs, carrion, garbage, and other birds.\nNestingWestern Gulls nest in colonies on islands, offshore rocks, and abandoned piers. Colonies are often located near nesting seabirds or sea lions. Birds first breed at the age of 4 years. Nests are built on the ground, and the pair often starts as many as three nests, and then chooses one to finish and use. The nest is often located next to a rock or other object that provides protection from the wind and a visual barrier from neighbors. The nest is a substantial mound built from nearby vegetation and debris. The female usually lays 3 eggs.  (Nests with more than three eggs are the result of multiple females.) Both members of the pair incubate the eggs for about a month. A few days after hatching, the young may leave the nest but won't go far, often hiding in nearby vegetation. At 6 to 7 weeks of age, they begin to fly, but don't become independent from their parents and depart the colony until they are 10 weeks or older.\n"}, {"family": "Ducks, Geese and Swans (Family Anatidae)", "description": "\n\nAdult Description Large, stocky diving duck.

Marbled Murrelets appear to establish long-term pair bonds, which are initiated at sea in the early spring, and seem to be maintained throughout the year. In March and April, Marbled Murrelet pairs appear in breeding areas, and most eggs are laid between April and July. The female lays a single egg high in a tree, or infrequently, in a nest on the ground. Of the known nests, 90% were in trees, and only 10% on the ground. Tree nests are located on the branch of a mature conifer, up to 150 feet off the ground. Nest trees are found in dense, mossy, old-growth stands, and the nest itself is typically located on a mat of moss and lichen. The nest is a depression in the moss, and the droppings of the young accumulate to form a rim. The parents take turns incubating the egg, changing places every morning at dawn.

In multi-species colonies, the Great Egrets tend to nest higher than other species.  The male selects the nest area where he displays to attract the female.  Both sexes build the stick nest, and both help incubate the 3-4 eggs for 23-26 days.  Both parents feed the young by regurgitation.

Shovelers will forage in sewage ponds and stagnant or polluted waters avoided by other species of ducks.\nBehaviorNorthern Shovelers rarely tip up, but filter mud through their bills, swimming with their heads outstretched, bills skimming the water's surface, sifting out food.

In some populations 90 percent of territorial males have more than one female nesting on their territories. But all is not as it seems: one-quarter to one-half of nestlings turn out to have been sired by someone other than the territorial male.Male Red-winged Blackbirds fiercely defend their territories during the breeding season, spending more than a quarter of daylight hours in territory defense.

In winter they often congregate in agricultural areas.\nBehaviorRed-winged Blackbirds are among the most well studied birds, especially in regard to behavior. They form flocks outside of the breeding season and nest close together. Although they pack tightly into small areas, they are very territorial during the breeding season. Males often sit up high on tall cattails surveying their territories and will aggressively fly after intruders with their red wing-patches displayed boldly. They forage on the ground, but will also forage in shrubs and trees.\nDietAbout 75% of the annual Red-winged Blackbird diet is seeds. During the breeding season, they also eat insects, especially dragonflies, mayflies, and caddis flies as they emerge from their aquatic larval stage. In winter, grain is an important source of food, and many birds feed on corn stubble and at feedlots.\nNestingRed-winged Blackbirds can breed colonially, but that may be more as a result of patchy breeding habitats than true colonialism. They are polygynous: males commonly mate with 2 to 4 females and can have as many as 15 mates. Nests are made of grass, and are usually lashed to cattails, bulrushes, or other emergent vegetation close to the water. The female incubates 3 to 4 eggs for 11 to 13 days.

The larger Yellow-headed Blackbird is dominant to the Red-winged Blackbird, and displaces the smaller blackbird from the prime nesting spots.

Like most herons, they capture prey with sudden thrusts of their bills.  They are most active at dawn and dusk.  When alarmed, the bittern extends its neck and head vertically and freezes or sways with the breeze, blending in with the surrounding vegetation.  Its eyes are set low on its head, enabling the bittern to see forward when it stands in this pose. The bizarre call of the American Bittern is the easiest way to locate this hard-to-find bird.  The call is often described as sounding like a water pump.  This dramatic and unusual vocalization is often heard at dusk or dawn and can carry long distances.

They inhabit freshwater and saltwater marshes, roadside ditches, and small agricultural runoff sites, and will even nest in invasive plants such as purple loosestrife and reed-canary grass.  In winter, they frequent a wider variety of habitats, including wet meadows and coastal dune grass.  In eastern Washington, early nests are typically built in cattails, but after mid-June, over 90% of the nests built are in bulrush.  (Bulrush grows in deeper water than cattails, and is more likely to be under water after the marsh has dried up around the shallower cattails.)  In western Washington, Marsh Wrens inhabit wetlands with both cattail and bulrush, and have also been known to nest in emergent hardhack.\nBehaviorMarsh Wrens glean food from the stems of dense marsh vegetation, from the ground, or on the water's surface.  They usually forage out of view, hopping up for brief moments when they can be seen by patient observers.  Like other wrens, male and female Marsh Wrens of all ages will destroy the eggs of their own and other species.  Washington's Marsh Wrens build between 14 and 22 incomplete 'dummy' nests, which may help with predator avoidance.  The dummy nests are also used throughout the year for shelter, and dummy nests of resident birds tend to be sturdier than dummy nests of migrants who do not use them for winter shelter.  In fact, western Washington Marsh Wrens, which use their dummy nests for shelter in the winter, spend significantly more time building them than their eastern Washington counterparts who migrate and don't need the winter roosts.   Male Marsh Wrens have up to 200 songs, which they sing almost continuously during the breeding season.  Their songs resemble the sound of a sewing machine.\nDietLike most wrens, Marsh Wrens eat primarily insects and spiders.  They eat aquatic insects as well.\nNestingMarsh Wrens are polygamous, with about half of the males in Washington having two or more females on their territory at one time.  The male builds many unfinished nests and then shows them to the female, who selects one and adds a lining to it.  This process starts in March in western Washington and in early April in eastern Washington.  The nest is anchored to standing vegetation, 1-3 feet off the ground, and is an oval mass of grasses, cattails, and sedges woven together with an entrance at the side.  The lining is made of fine grass, plant down, and feathers.  The female incubates 4 to 5 eggs for 13 to 16 days, and broods the young for about a week after they hatch.  In western Washington, males help feed the young, but in eastern Washington, males don't help feed the early-season clutches.  Later in the season, when there is less chance of attracting new mates, they will help feed.  The young leave the nest after about 13 to 15 days.  In western Washington, the parents continue to feed the young for another week or two.  Once the young have fully fledged, the female will raise a second brood.\n"}, {"family": "Tyrant Flycatchers (Family Tyrannidae)", "description": "\n\nAdult DescriptionSmall flycatcher.

In winter, they frequent coastal areas and mangrove swamps.\nBehaviorThe solitary Green Heron usually forages from a perch, where it stands with its body lowered and stretched out horizontally, ready to thrust its bill at unsuspecting prey.  One of the few birds known to use tools, the Green Heron will attract prey with bait (feathers, small sticks, or berries) that it drops into the water.  When out in the open, it commonly flicks its tail nervously and raises and lowers its crest.  Another characteristic behavior of the Green Heron, which may help with identification, is its tendency to fly away from a disturbance giving a squawk and defecating in a white stream behind itself. (Other small herons defecate forward.)  When alarmed, the Green Heron may adopt the classic bittern stance, with head held vertical, looking across the base of its bill. The Green Heron commonly calls in flight--a sharp skeow or kyow sound.\nDietFish are the primary food of this opportunistic feeder.  Crayfish and other crustaceans are also a source of food, as are aquatic insects, frogs, grasshoppers, snakes, and rodents.\nNestingGreen Herons typically nest in trees near the water.  Males stake out territories and call to attract females.  Sometimes pairs form in migration, and the pair will select the site together.  Unlike most herons, the Green Heron does not typically nest in large colonies.  The male starts the nest, bringing long, thin sticks to the female who finishes the nest.  Both parents incubate the 3 to 5 eggs for about 19 to 21 days.  Once the young hatch, both parents feed them by regurgitating food.  Both help brood the young for about three weeks.  At about 16 to 17 days, the young climb about near the nest, and they first start to fly at 21 to 23 days.

Canada Geese breed in northern temperate, sub-arctic and arctic regions and nest in Canada, Alaska, and all of the lower 48 states.  They are found at a broad range of elevations, from coastal through alpine, and occupy a broad range of habitats, as long as there is water nearby. They are found in ponds, lakes, reservoirs, bays, estuaries, marshes, pastures and fields, city and suburban parks, golf courses, and grassy waterfront yards.  Canada Geese prefer riverine areas for breeding, but will nest in a wide variety of wetland habitats.  During winter and migration, Canada Geese are commonly seen in agricultural areas, foraging on grain, winter wheat, and pasture grasses.\nBehaviorCanada Geese graze while walking on land, and feed on submerged aquatic vegetation by reaching under the water with their long necks or by upending.  They are strong swimmers, flyers, and divers. During winter and migration, Canada Geese subspecies often flock together and mix with Cackling Geese; flocks may contain over 1000 birds. At migration stopover areas, disputes over food can lead to physical encounters between individuals; during fights, Canada Geese grab each other's breast or throat with their bills and land blows with their wings. Canada Geese are extremely territorial during the breeding season; males defend territories from other geese, humans, and nest predators by displays which may include lowering the head to the ground with the bill open, pumping the head up and down, and hissing.Canada Geese are known for their \"honking\" call and most subspecies are very vocal in flight.\nDietCanada Geese are primarily herbivores and feed on a wide variety of plants and aquatic vegetation. In winter and during migration, waste grain left in plowed fields make up the majority of their diet.  During the spring and summer, their diets include more green vegetation.  Insects, mollusks, crustaceans, and occasionally small fish are also eaten.  Urban populations of Canada Geese have adapted to grazing on domesticated grasses throughout the year. Some local populations in Washington forage on eelgrass.\nNestingCanada Geese form long-term pair bonds, generally during their second year. The female chooses the nest-site on a slightly elevated spot near water with good visibility. She then builds the nest, a shallow bowl with a slight depression, made of sticks, grass, and weeds, and lined with down. She lays and incubates 4 to 7 eggs, while the male stands guard nearby.  Incubation last approximately twenty-eight days.  Once hatched, the young leave the nest within one to two days, at which time they are able to walk, swim, feed, and dive.  Both parents lead the offspring to feeding areas, but do not provide food.  Young are able to fly within seven to nine weeks after hatching, depending on the subspecies, and remain with their parents throughout their first year.\n"}, {"family": "Ducks, Geese and Swans (Family Anatidae)", "description": "\n\n\n\nSize & Shape\nGadwall are about the same size as Mallards.

They are opportunistic feeders - scavengers at times, predators at others. When scavenging, they are often seen on the ground or on the bank of a river or other body of water. Sometimes they steal food from other raptors. When hunting, they swoop down to the water or ground with feet thrust forward to snatch their prey. The undersides of eagle's feet are rough, and keep the fish from slipping from the eagle's grasp.\nDietBald Eagles eat many fish, live fish that they snatch from the water and dead fish, especially spawned salmon, which they pick up from stream-sides. They also eat ducks and other water birds as well as small mammals. In the San Juan Islands, rabbits, hunted living or scavenged dead, are the main source of food. In many parts of Washington in winter, American Coots are an important part of the diet as well.\nNestingBald Eagles build large stick nests called eyries in tall trees or on cliffs. They continue to build up the eyries year after year until they are massive, up to 9 feet in diameter and weighing up to 2,000 pounds. Bald Eagles do not breed until they are 4 to 6 years old, but when they pair for mating they tend to remain paired for life. The egg-laying season is generally late winter to early spring. In western Washington, sometime during the last days of February and the first days of March, the female lays 2 eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs for 34 to 36 days. For the first two weeks after the young hatch, one parent is with the chicks almost constantly. The young do not start to fly until they are 10 to 12 weeks old, and the parents continue to feed and defend them for another 2 to 3 months.\n"}, {"family": "Vireos (Family Vireonidae)", "description": "\n\n\n\nSize & Shape\nRed-eyed Vireos are large, chunky vireos with a long, angular head, thick neck, and a strong, long bill with a small but noticeable hook at the tip.

Bradford Torrey wrote in 1889, \"I have always thought that whoever dubbed this vireo the 'preacher' could have had no very exalted opinion of the clergy.\" But each male sings 30 or more different songs, and neighbors have unique repertoires. Over 12,500 different Red-eyed Vireo song types have been recorded. On May 27, 1952, Louise de Kiriline Lawrence counted the number of songs sung by a single Red-eyed Vireo seeking a mate on his territory 180 miles north of Toronto. He sang 22,197 songs in the 14 hours from just before dawn to evening, singing for 10 of those hours.From the 1920s to the 1940s Red-eyed Vireos expanded west into Utah and Oregon and northeast into Newfoundland. The most likely cause is new shelterbelts and landscaping, particularly where eastern tree species were planted.

Female Sharp-shinned Hawks are about a third bigger and heavier than males. This is a typical pattern for many hawks and owls, but otherwise rare in the bird world.The size difference between the sexes in Sharp-shinned Hawks influences the size of prey they can catch. Nestlings feed first on small prey caught mainly by their father, switching as they grow to the larger prey that their mother can bring.  Before delivering prey to their mates or young, male Sharp-shinned Hawks typically remove and eat the head. Adult Sharp-shinned Hawks continue to feed their offspring for several weeks after the youngsters have fledged. At first, they drop dead prey into the nest for the young to consume, but, as the fledglings gain skill, the parents switch to passing prey to the young hawks in flight.

This agility allows the bird to hunt successfully around bird feeders. The secretive traits and inconspicuous nature that allow the Sharp-shinned Hawk to surprise its prey also make it difficult to observe. Sharp-shinned Hawks often have a plucking post near their nests, where they go to pluck feathers from prey, leaving an accumulation of feathers and whitewash at the base of a stump, fence post, or fallen tree.\nDietSmall birds (sparrow-sized up to robins and occasionally quail) are the most common prey, although small rodents, reptiles, and large insects are part of the diet as well.

The nest is made of large twigs lined with bark, and is often built on top of an old squirrel or crow nest. Male and female help collect material for the nest, although the female does most of the building. She incubates 3 to 5 eggs for 30 to 32 days, while the male brings food to her. The female broods the young for the first 16 to 23 days, and the male continues to provide food, which the female feeds to the young.

The female incubates 5 to 6 eggs.  The male brings her food while she is on the nest and continues to bring food after the young hatch.  The female broods for about 18 days.  Once brooding is finished, she may help the male provide the young with food or she may depart, sometimes finding a new mate and raising a second brood.  The young leave the nest at 4 to 5 weeks, and are fed for another 6 to 8 weeks.

Many (but not all) juveniles   hatched earlier (from late winter and early spring) begin to molt 100-110 days   after hatching and then again during the main molt period in the summer.

A bird's biting muscles are stronger than the muscles   used to open the bill, so the Red Crossbill places the tips of its slightly   open bill under a cone scale and bites down. The crossed tips of the bill push   the scale up, exposing the seed inside.

They typically climb in mature conifers, using their bills to grab branches and cones.  They will also occasionally land on deciduous trees and forage for aphids.  Their bills are adapted for removing seeds from cones, and they start at the bottom of a cone and spiral upward, prying open each scale and removing the seeds with their tongues.  The bills can cross in either direction, and the direction of the cross dictates the direction that the bird spirals up the cone.  Each type has a distinct flight call, which is helpful in identification and may play a role in maintaining the isolation of each group.\nDietConifer seeds make up the main diet of Red Crossbills.  They also eat the buds of some trees, weed seeds, berries, and some insects, especially aphids.\nNestingThe breeding cycle of Red Crossbills is more closely tied to food availability than it is to season.  They can breed at almost any time of year, and will do so even in mid-winter if there is an abundant source of seeds.  They are monogamous, and pairs form within flocks.  The female builds the nest, which is located on a horizontal branch high up in a conifer tree.  The nest is a bulky cup of loose twigs, grass, and bark strips, lined with fine grass, lichen, feathers, and hair.  The female typically incubates 3 eggs for 12 to 16 days.  The male brings food to the incubating female and to the young for the first few days after they hatch.  After five days of continuous brooding, the female joins the male in bringing food to the young.  The young leave the nest after 18 to 22 days.  The parents continue to feed the young for about a month after they hatch.  The bills of young birds are not crossed at hatching, but cross as they grow.

As the bird quickly rotates its wings forward and backward. The air that rushes into the temporary vacuum beneath the wings creates a miniature vacuum, generating a deep, thumping sound wave that carries up to a quarter of a mile. The early conservationist Aldo Leopold wrote of the Ruffed Grouse, \u201cThe autumn landscape in the north woods is the land, plus a red maple, plus a Ruffed Grouse. In terms of conventional physics, the grouse represents only a millionth of either the mass or the energy of an acre yet subtract the grouse and the whole thing is dead.\u201dRuffed Grouse\u2019s popularity as a game bird led to some of North America\u2019s earliest game management efforts: New York had a closed season (no hunting in part of the year) on Ruffed Grouse starting in 1708. Ruffed Grouse can digest bitter, often toxic plants that many birds can\u2019t handle. Levels of defensive plant compounds in buds of quaking aspen, a major winter-time food source for Ruffed Grouse, reflect the cyclic rise and fall of grouse populations: they\u2019re lowest when grouse densities are increasing, and highest when grouse densities decline.Ruffed Grouse can consume and digest large volumes of fibrous vegetation thanks to extra-long, paired pouches at the junction of the small and large intestines. \n\nIn the northern part of their range, Ruffed Grouse depend on snow as a wintertime roost, burying themselves at night in soft drifts that provide insulating cover. Birds in the south seek out dense stands of conifers that offer protection from chilling winds.The toes of Ruffed Grouse grow projections off their sides in winter, making them look like combs. The projections are believed to act as snowshoes to help the grouse walk across snow.In much of their range, Ruffed Grouse populations go through 8-to-11-year cycles of increasing and decreasing numbers. Their cycles can be attributed to the snowshoe hare cycle. When hare populations are high, predator populations increase too. When the hare numbers go down, the predators must find alternate prey and turn to grouse, decreasing their numbers.

They can also be found along river corridors and throughout forested areas of Washington. They do well in early successional woods, forest openings, and along forest edges. In western Washington, they are most often found near black cottonwood, bigleaf maple, vine maple, and Sitka spruce. In eastern Washington, the quaking aspen is the most important tree species for Ruffed Grouse.\nBehaviorAlthough not prone to flocking, they are often found in small groups, especially around winter food sources or when the families are still together. In the breeding season, males carry out their courtship display on a fallen log, puffing out their feathers, fanning their tails, and showing their ruffs while drumming the air with their wings.  The drumming can be heard from far away, each drum roll starting out slowly and quickly picking up speed.\nDietRuffed Grouse forage on the ground and in shrubs and trees. They are omnivores, although they feed mostly on plant material. In the winter, they eat the buds of deciduous trees, especially in areas where it snows. The large buds of aspen trees are an important winter food source. They also eat fruits, berries, twigs, leaves, catkins, and seeds. In the summer, they eat insects, spiders, snails, small snakes, and frogs. Young Ruffed Grouse eat mostly insects.\nNestingOne male may mate with several females and does not participate in caring for the young. The female builds a nest on the ground in dense cover, usually next to a log, rock, or at the base of a tree or shrub. The nest is a depression lined with leaves, grass, needles, and some feathers. The female lays and incubates 9-12 eggs. The well-camouflaged young leave the nest shortly after hatching.

They breed up to the tree line, particularly in open or fragmented forests, but are typically found at lower elevations than are Gray Jays.\nBehaviorSteller's Jays form flocks outside of the nesting season and often fly across clearings in single file. They are highly vocal outside of the nesting season.  When they are raising young or robbing nests, Steller's Jays become very quiet and inconspicuous.  They are well known at feeders, picnic areas, and campgrounds where they beg boldly for handouts with loud, raspy calls.  These intelligent and opportunistic birds are quick to take advantage of new food sources, including bird feeders, especially those full of peanuts.  They cache extra nuts, making sure that the food is covered from all directions.  They pound on hard nuts with their bills to break them open.  They forage primarily in trees, but may forage lower at times.  Steller's Jays have complex social hierarchies and dominance patterns.\nDietSteller's Jays are omnivores, and their diets are about 2/3 vegetable-matter and 1/3 animal-matter.  The vegetable portion of their diet consists of seeds, nuts, berries, and fruits, and the animal-matter portion consists of bird eggs and nestlings, invertebrates, suet, small rodents, reptiles, and carrion.  They eat almost any scraps that humans give them. They appear to be major predators of other species' eggs.\nNestingSteller's Jays form monogamous, long-term pair bonds.  They remain together year round.  They typically nest in a conifer, and both members of the pair help build the nest.  The nest is a bulky cup made of twigs, weeds, moss, and leaves, held together with mud.  The nest is usually lined with rootlets, pine needles, and other fine material, often with bits of paper adorning the outside.  The female typically incubates 4-5 eggs for 16-18 days.  Both members of the pair feed the young, which leave the nest at about 16 days.  They begin making short flights within a few days of fledging, and can make sustained flights by the age of 30 days, which is about when they begin to find their own food.

The song of the Orange-crowned Warbler is an accelerating trill that drops in pitch at the end.\nDietOrange-crowned Warblers eat mostly insects, but supplement that diet with berries, suet, tree sap, and flower nectar. They pierce the base of a flower to get at the nectar, and visit woodpecker and sapsucker holes for tree sap.

Coastal habitat is typically in the shallow, intertidal zones along rocky coastlines, where rough surf is the norm.\nBehaviorHarlequin Ducks are well adapted to their harsh surroundings. They make their way against the current and easily climb up steep and slippery rocks, although many have been found with broken bones, presumably from being dashed against rocks in the rough surf. Like other diving ducks they forage under water, although in addition to diving they also walk along the bottom or dabble. When they find food at the bottom, they pry it open with their bills.\nDietIn coastal habitat, mollusks and crustaceans make up the bulk of the diet. Some small fish and marine worms are also eaten.  On rivers, aquatic insects are the main prey, especially larvae attached to rocks on the river bottom.\nNestingMost females first breed at the age of two, and males at the age of three, although breeding success for many birds remains low until they are five years old. Pairs form during winter and spring, and dissolve after the female begins incubation. At this time, the male leaves the female and the breeding territory.

They favor rocky substrates and clear, cold water, not unlike salmon.  They can be found down to sea level, and up to alpine zones, as long as there are suitable streams.  Dippers also occasionally inhabit pond or lake edges, or quiet sections of streams.  During winter, they may show up in unusual habitats, but will most always be found in or near water.\nBehaviorDippers take their name from their characteristic bobbing.  Unlike a Spotted Sandpiper or other tail-bobber, dippers move their entire bodies up and down.  This bobbing, and the flashing of the white upper eyelid, may be visual communications that are important because of the loud environment that American Dippers tend to inhabit.  Dippers catch most of their food under water, and jump or dive into frigid water to forage.  They walk, heads submerged, along river bottoms, moving rocks to find prey underneath.  The dipper takes prey from the water's surface while swimming, and will even use its wings to 'fly' under water.  This bird will also fly through waterfalls.  These birds are generally solitary and defend both summer and winter territories.  Their calls and songs are loud, audible above the sound of rushing water.\nDietAquatic insects, especially larvae attached to river bottoms, make up the majority of the American Dipper's diet.  They also eat other small aquatic creatures, including fish eggs and very small fish, and will feed at salmon spawning areas.\nNestingDippers are typically monogamous, but polygyny does occasionally occur.  Nest sites are generally the limiting factor for breeding American Dippers, so a male with a territory that includes two appropriate nest sites may mate with two females.  Dippers historically nested on ledges or banks along the sides of streams or behind waterfalls, and many still do.  Now, however, nests are often found under bridges as well.  Nests are large, mossy domes, up to a foot in diameter, and spray from the stream keeps the moss alive.  The female chooses the nest site, and both members of the pair help build the nest, often dipping nesting material in the water before adding it to the nest.  The nest has an outer shell of moss and grass, with a low entrance on a side facing the water.  Inside is a cup made of grass, leaves, and bark strips.  The female incubates 4 to 5 eggs for 13 to 17 days while the male provides food.  Once the young hatch, the female broods them for about a week, and then joins the male in providing food for them.  The young leave the nest at 24 to 26 days, and can swim and dive immediately after leaving the nest.

They are particularly common in streamside thickets and woods adjacent to agricultural fields, although they can be found in most habitats with the exception of the forest interior. Historically, they inhabited short-grass prairies, but with development, agriculture, and forest fragmentation, they have been able to expand their range significantly and now prefer human-modified habitats.\nBehaviorHistorically, Brown-headed Cowbirds probably followed herds of bison, walking behind them to take advantage of food kicked up in the bison's wake.

This practice may provide the calcium they need to produce the large number of eggs they lay.\nNestingBrown-headed Cowbirds have unusual breeding behavior: they never build nests or raise their own young. Males typically arrive on the breeding grounds before the females. Pairs are generally monogamous. Females lay eggs in other birds' nests and leave the rearing to other species. They find nests to parasitize by looking for birds building nests, either by walking along the ground, perching quietly in shrubs or trees, or making noisy flights back and forth, possibly to flush potential hosts. The female generally chooses an open cup-nest to parasitize, and usually lays one egg per nest. She waits to lay the egg until the host bird has at least one egg in its nest, and often removes one egg from the nest before laying her own. She continues the process over a period of about a month and can lay up to 40 eggs a season. Incubation time is short, 10 to 12 days, which allows the young cowbird to get a head start in the nest. Young cowbirds grow rapidly, giving them a competitive advantage over the other young in the nest. Young cowbirds usually leave the nest after 8 to 13 days, but are not fully independent from the hosts until they are about 25 to 39 days old. Then they typically form small flocks with other juveniles.

The new feathers they grow in fall have bold white tips \u2013 that\u2019s what gives them their spots. By spring, these tips have worn away, and the rest of the feather is dark and iridescent brown. It\u2019s an unusual changing act that scientists term \u201cwear molt.\u201dStarlings are strong fliers that can get up to speeds of 48 mph.In studies of starlings\u2019 sense of taste, scientists have discovered that they can taste salt, sugars, citric acid, and tannins (bitter compounds that occur in many fruits, including acorns and grapes). They can tell the difference between sucrose (table sugar) and other kinds of sugars \u2013 helpful since starlings lack the ability to digest sucrose.A female European Starling may try to lay an egg in the nest of another female. A female that tries this parasitic tactic often is one that could not get a mate early in the breeding season. The best females find mates and start laying early. The longer it takes to get started, the lower the probability of a nest's success. Those parasitic females may be trying to enhance their own breeding efforts during the time that they cannot breed on their own.The oldest recorded wild European Starling was 15 years 9 months old.", "common_name": "European Starling", "call": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/sounds/eust1.mp3", "images": [{"contributor": "Greg Lavaty", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/EUST_gl.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/dadas115"}, {"contributor": "Greg Lavaty", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/EUST_w_gl.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/dadas115"}, {"contributor": "Greg Lavaty", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/EUST_j_gl.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/dadas115"}, {"contributor": "Greg Lavaty", "src": "http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/images/EUST_fl_gl.jpg", "contributor_url": "http://www.pbase.com/dadas115"}], "life_history": "\nHabitatStarlings are typically associated with disturbed areas and human-altered settings.  They can be found in practically all habitats, with the exception of large tracts of undisturbed forests and undeveloped alpine areas.  They usually forage in open areas, especially lawns, agricultural fields, or other developed areas, but require nearby nesting cavities.\nBehaviorEuropean Starlings tend to form flocks year round, but flocks are generally larger'and often huge'in fall and winter.  They often forage with other species, including Red-winged Blackbirds, Brown-headed Cowbirds, American Robins, House Sparrows, crows, and Rock Doves.  When foraging, they generally walk or run along the ground and probe the soil with their bills, looking for food.  Starlings can be aggressive and will persistently harass other species to take over nesting cavities.  They will also mob predators in flight, gathering into tight flocks and dive-bombing a hawk or other predator.  Starlings are intelligent and adaptable, and are capable mimics.\nDietStarlings eat a diverse, omnivorous diet of invertebrates, berries and other fruit, grains, and seeds.  They commonly come to seed and suet feeders.\nNestingStarlings are generally monogamous, but can be polygamous. They begin nesting early in the breeding season. Males establish territories and choose nest sites, then attract females.  European Starlings are cavity nesters, and nests are generally located in natural hollows, old woodpecker holes, birdhouses, or building eaves and crevices.  The male generally starts the nest, and the female finishes the job, often removing material that the male placed initially.  The nest is a loose pile of twigs, weeds, grass, feathers, leaves, and other material, with a depression in the middle.  Both members of the pair help incubate 4 to 6 eggs for about 12 days.  Females will sometimes lay eggs in other starlings' nests.  Both adults help brood the young and bring food to the nest.  The young leave the nest after about three weeks.  The parents may continue to feed the young for a day or two after they fledge, but the young can forage on their own at that time. If this is the first brood, the female typically starts laying a second brood shortly after the first one fledges.  The male may provide support for up to 12 days after the young leave the nest, and the young often join other newly fledged young on communal roosts.\n"}, {"family": "Pigeons and Doves (Family Columbidae)", "description": "\n\n\n\nSize & Shape\nLarger and plumper than a Mourning Dove, Rock Pigeons are tubby birds with small heads and short legs.

Scientists estimate between 267 million and 1.4 billion individuals.House Finches were introduced to Oahu from San Francisco sometime before 1870. They had become abundant on all the major Hawaiian Islands by 1901.The red of a male House Finch comes from pigments contained in its food during molt (birds can\u2019t make bright red or yellow colors directly). So the more pigment in the food, the redder the male. This is why people sometimes see orange or yellowish male House Finches.

They also frequent freshwater lakes, agricultural fields, cities, and garbage dumps in coastal areas. They are sometimes found far offshore, well out of sight of land, but are less common far inland. Nesting habitat is mainly low, flat islands, with sandy, rocky, or gravel substrates. Building roofs in cities along Puget Sound have also been used as nesting habitat. Nests within Puget Sound are usually located in human-altered habitats, while nests along the coast are typically in natural settings.\nBehaviorGlaucous-winged Gulls forage in a variety of styles--while walking, flying, or swimming. Like other large gulls, they have been observed dropping shellfish onto rocks and other hard surfaces from far above in order to crack them open. They steal food from other seabirds and prey on young birds, especially those nesting nearby. Very bold, they will approach picnic tables and other human-occupied areas, scavenging and looking for handouts.\nDietOmnivores, Glaucous-winged Gulls will eat most anything, but items most often ingested include fish and other marine creatures, small birds, eggs, small mammals, invertebrates from waterlogged fields, and refuse from dumps, sewage ponds, trash cans, and parking lots.\nNestingGlaucous-winged Gulls breed all along the coast of Washington (and less commonly in eastern Washington) in monogamous pairs that typically last for multiple breeding seasons. Nesting is usually in colonies, and birds first breed at four years of age. Nests are usually on the ground. The spot is scraped clean, and a ring of vegetation and nearby debris is built up. Sometimes more than one nest is started, but only one is completed and used. Both parents incubate the 2-3 eggs for about four weeks. Newborn chicks are covered in down and may leave the nest as soon as two days post-hatching, although they stay near the nest. Both parents feed the young, which first begin to fly at 5-7 weeks old, and leave the colony about 2 weeks afterwards.\n"}, {"family": "Gulls and Terns (Family Laridae)", "description": "\n\nAdult DescriptionLarge, gull-like tern.

They are not usually found on open ocean, but prefer protected waters. Nesting usually takes place on low sand or gravel islands with sparse vegetation. In Washington, the birds have shifted their preferred habitat from natural sites inland to coastal, human-altered sites (often islands made from dredged material). They have also shifted from nesting in small groups mixed with gulls to large colonies of only Caspian Terns.\nBehaviorCaspian Terns are less gregarious than other terns, nesting in smaller colonies, although this is changing in Washington. They can be quite aggressive. When foraging, they fly with their bills pointing downward. When they spot a fish, they hover and then plunge into the water after it, often submerging completely. Their broad wings allow them to soar, gull-like, flapping with strong, slow wing-beats.\nDietThe vast majority of the diet of the Caspian Tern is fish, especially those that swim near the surface of the water. In the Columbia River estuary, where most of Washington's population breeds, salmonid smolts are a major prey item.\nNestingFirst breeding at the age of three years, Caspian Terns nest in colonies in areas with no vegetation, often on islands. Both parents help build the nest, which is located on the ground and can range from a scrape in the sand to a depression lined with a sturdy rim of vegetation and mollusk and crustacean shells. Both parents incubate the 1 to 3 eggs for about three weeks. A few days after hatching, the young may leave the nest but stay nearby, or they may remain at the nest until ready to fly.
